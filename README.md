# CSE310Project1
The full project description and details are in the file p1.pdf.

This project was to simulate encoding and decoding data over the network. 
We used compression ratios and measured and compared time complexity for both insertion and quicksort.
This was intended to compare the difference between recursive algorithms vs linear algorithms.
The outcome is recorded in report.pdf.
