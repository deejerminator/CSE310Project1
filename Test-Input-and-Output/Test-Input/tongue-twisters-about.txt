Tongue twisters of all sorts and sizes have been raising laughs and knotting tongues for decades.
For example, the world-famous Peter Piper tongue twister first appeared in print sometime in 1813, in a book called ``Peter Pipers Practical Principles of Plain and Perfect Pronunciation'' (a tongue twister in itself, isnt it?).
Nevertheless, to this day, people all around the world still love to have a laugh and improve their pronunciation with a good ol tongue twister.

So whats a tongue twister?
Cambridge Dictionary defines it as ``a sentence or phrase that is intended to be difficult to say, especially when repeated quickly and often''. 
Tongue twisters dont make a lot of sense, but they are filled with repeated sounds making them extremely helpful in speech therapy.
Basically, a tongue twister works the same way as physical exercise.
The more you practice, the better your pronunciation will be. 
What is more, tongue twisters were  and probably still are used by actors before a representation, by politicians before a speech and even by news anchors before going live.
